# Challenge-1: Predictive Sales Modeling

## Project Description

The Challenge-1 project is a predictive sales modeling tool built using Python and various machine learning libraries. The project aims to analyze sales data from different products and provide predicted sales figures. The project uses historical sales data from two products: soap nuts and wool balls.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Sales Modeling**: The project uses machine learning algorithms to predict future sales based on historical data.
- **Product Comparison**: The project allows for the analysis of sales data from multiple products.
- **Data Visualization**: The project provides a foundation for visualizing sales data using various libraries.

## Installation Instructions

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ps1.git`
2. Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate` (on Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows)
4. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage Examples

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Run the `main.py` script using `python main.py`
2. The script will load the sales data from the `dataset` directory and train a machine learning model to predict future sales.
3. The predicted sales figures will be printed to the console.

## Project Structure Overview

The project consists of the following directories and files:

- `dataset`: contains the historical sales data for soap nuts and wool balls.
- `main.py`: the main script that trains the machine learning model and predicts future sales.

## Dependencies and Requirements

The project requires the following dependencies:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `torch`
- `scikit-learn`
- `python` (version 3.8 or later)
